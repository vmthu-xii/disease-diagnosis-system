# Project ADIP - Diagnostic and Prognostic System

This project was developed as a project for the Applications of Digital Image and Video Processing course.

The repository leverages the work of J.H. Moon's [MedVill](https://github.com/SuperSupermoon/MedViLL), a Vision-Language Model based on the Transformer architecture, specifically BERT.

In this project, I fine-tuned the MedVill model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset to classify chest diseases using multimodal data, including X-ray images and accompanying medical reports.

Additionally, I applied QLoRA to enable a large language model to generate appropriate treatment methods based on the predicted disease.
